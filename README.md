# Algorithms and data structures. Laboratory work â„– 1
 All this is the first laboratory work on algorithms and data structures. All this is the first laboratory work on algorithms and data structures implemented on Java:
- Binary Search 
- Ladder Algorithm 
- Ladder Algorithm with Exponential acceleration.

<b>First, let's take a little look at the algorithms. We'll start with binary search.
Its complexity is O(logN). In the case of the matrix, the speed of operation will be O(log(N) * m) where m is the height at which the target is located. 
The idea of the implementation is to view the matrix from top to bottom and run the search algorithm in turn. When the number is found, the program stops. </b>

The next in line is the Ladder Algorithm. Its complexity is O(N + M) where N and M are the dimensions of the matrix.
